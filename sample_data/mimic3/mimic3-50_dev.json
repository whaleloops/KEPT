You were admitted\nfor chest pain and were found to have a heart attack.  You went\nfor catheterization and a balloon was used to open one of the\narteries perfusing your heart. You have done well since then and\nare ready to go home. It is important to follow up with the\n[**Hospital3 **] cardiologist within the next 1 week.\n.\nBefore your catheterization, you vomited blood. We believe that\nthis was due to a small tear in your esophagus caused by\nretching, which should heal on its own. However, you could have\nmore serious problems in your stomach and should have an\nendoscopy done as an outpatient. You can help arrange this with\nyour primary care doctor. Please make sure to see your\ncardiologist this coming week.\nYou vomited blood during this admission. It is very important to\nfollow this up with your PCP.

You were\nadmitted for a heart attack caused by a clot in one of your\ncoronary arteries. You had a cardiac catheterization and a drug\neluting stent was placed. You were started on plavix which you\nwill need to take for at least a year to prevent clotting of\nthis stent. You were also started on atorvastatin to reduce risk\nof coronary artery disease.\n  During your cardiac cath an area of narrowing was seen in one\nof your vessels. As this has not caused you any symptoms, we\nwill medically manage you at present and you should have a\nstress test in about 2 wks. A test has been ordered and you need\nto speak with your primary care doctor in order to schedule this\ntest. You will have follow up with a cardiologist to further\nmanage your problems - if you choose to see a cardiologist\ncloser to home, that's fine and you can cancel the appointment\nwe have made.\n   During this admission it was also found that you have\ndiabetes. This can significantly increase your risk of cardiac\ndiseases. You should exercise and eat healthily to try to\ndecrease this risk. You should also follow up with your PCP to\ndiscuss whether you would benefit from starting on medication.\n   Please call or return to the hospital if you develop chest\npain, shortness of breath, leg swelling, or any other symptoms\nthat concern you.\n-------------------\n\nPlease START the following medications:\n- Plavix (Clopidogrel) 75mg daily\n- Atorvastatin 80mg daily\n- Metoprolol succinate 25mg daily\nPlease STOP the following medications:\n- hydrochlorothiazide\nPlease CONTINUE Losartan 50 mg per day\nThe following medications have CHANGED:\n- Aspirin should now be taken at 325mg daily (not 81mg)\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nName: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] F.\nLocation: [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) 3860**] [**Last Name (Titles) 662**]-[**Location (un) **]\/WESTW\nAddress: [**Street Address(2) 21600**], [**Apartment Address(1) **], [**Location (un) **],[**Numeric Identifier 9310**]\nPhone: [**Telephone\/Fax (1) 17753**]\nAppt: [**5-22**] at 9:30am\n\nName: [**Last Name (LF) 5858**], [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] MD\nLocation: [**Hospital1 **] CARDIOLOGY\nAddress: [**Street Address(2) **], [**Location (un) **],[**Numeric Identifier 3002**]\nPhone: [**Telephone\/Fax (1) 4105**]\nAppt:  [**6-3**] at 10:30am\n\n\n\n",
  "Addition": "Echo: PATIENT\/TEST INFORMATION:\nIndication: Myocardial infarction.\nHeight: (in) 68\nWeight (lb): 200\nBSA (m2): 2.05 m2\nBP (mm Hg): 154\/83\nHR (bpm): 64\nStatus: Inpatient\nDate\/Time: [**2121-5-15**] at 09:59\nTest: Portable TTE (Complete)\nDoppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler\nContrast: None\nTechnical Quality: Adequate\n\n\nINTERPRETATION:\n\nFindings:\n\nLEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.\n\nRIGHT ATRIUM\/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. The IVC was not visualized.\nThe RA pressure could not be estimated.\n\nLEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and global systolic\nfunction (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion\nabnormality cannot be fully excluded. No resting LVOT gradient.\n\nLV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: basal\ninferolateral - hypo; mid inferolateral - hypo;\n\nRIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.\n\nAORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal ascending aorta\ndiameter.\n\nAORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.\n\nMITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.\n\nTRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial TR. Normal PA\nsystolic pressure.\n\nPULMONIC VALVE\/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet. No PS.\nPhysiologic PR.\n\nPERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most\nlikely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion\ncannot be excluded.\n\nGENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views.\n\nConclusions:\nThe left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular\nhypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).\nThere is regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of\nthe basal and mid inferolateral segments. Due to suboptimal technical quality,\nadditional focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve\nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no\naortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally\nnormal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery\nsystolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an\nanterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.\n\nIMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity\nsize and globally preserved systolic function. Left ventricular regional wall\nmotion abnormalities as described above. No clinically significant valvular\ndisease. Normal pulmonary artery systolic pressure.\n\n\n\tECG: Sinus rhythm.  Inferior myocardial infarction with ST-T wave configuration\nsuggesting acute\/recent\/in evolution process.  Since the previous tracing of\nthe same date no significant change.\nTRACING #4\n\n\tECG: Sinus rhythm.  inferior myocardial infarction with ST-T wave configuration\nsuggesting acute process.  Clinical correlation is suggested.  Since the\nprevious tracing of [**2121-5-14**] the rate is slower and inferior lead ST-T wave\nchanges are less prominent.\nTRACING #3\n\n\tECG: Sinus rhythm.  Inferior myocardial infarction with ST-T wave configuration\nconsistent with acute process.  Since the previous tracing of the same date\nprominent inferior lead Q waves and further ST-T wave changes are both now\npresent.\nTRACING #2\n\n\tECG: Sinus rhythm.  ST-T wave configuration is consistent with acute inferoposterior\nischemic injury and possible infarction.  Consider left posterior fascicular\nblock.  No previous tracing available for comparison.\nTRACING #1\n\n\tRadiology: [**2121-5-16**] 11:10 AM\n CHEST (PA & LAT)                                                Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 6833**]\n Reason: Cardiopulmonary process\n Admitting Diagnosis: ST ELEVATED MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n [**Hospital 2**] MEDICAL CONDITION:\n  72 year old man with fever\n REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:\n  Cardiopulmonary process\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph [**2121-5-16**].\n\n CLINICAL HISTORY:  72-year-old man with fever.  Evaluate for acute\n cardiopulmonary process.\n\n FINDINGS:\n\n There are no previous studies available for direct comparison.\n\n The cardiac silhouette and mediastinum is within normal limits.  There are\n some minimal densities at the lung bases, most compatible with atelectasis as\n opposed to early infiltrates.  There is no focal consolidation.  The\n visualized upper lung fields are grossly clear.  Bony structures are intact.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n Hazy densities at the lung bases, most compatible with atelectasis.  Early\n infiltrate is felt less likely.\n\n"
